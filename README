A Django app for generating srcsets, automatically resizing the images
and specifying the correct markup.


FULL FUNCTIONALITY STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!!! This is version 0.6.0.

Version 1.0 (release) will allow specifying width or width/height for
single images and sets of images for the srcset attribute. Cropping
options will be supported as well.


For now, this can be installed from the GitHub repo with Pip:

	pip install git+https://github.com/ConvectiveSoftware/django-srcset.git

Version 1.0 will be made available on PyPI.


For the most part, this app is intended to be used via template tags.
A demonstation of currently supported functionality follows.

	{% load srcset %}

	{# resize and crop an image attached to instance to fit 500x500 #}
	<img src="{% src instance.image_field 500x500 %}"/>

	{# resize (without cropping) to fit 500x500 #}
	{# note: resulting size will likely not match both dimensions #}
	<img src="{% src instance.image_field 500x500 nocrop %}"/>
	
	{# resize image multiple times and create srcset #}
	<img srcset="{% srcset instance.image_field 400x400 800x800 1600x1600 %}">
	
	{# srcset also accepts the nocrop option #}
	<img srcset="{% srcset instance.image_field 400x400 800x800 nocrop %}">
