A Django app for generating srcsets, automatically resizing the images
and specifying the correct markup.

FULL FUNCTIONALITY STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!!! This is version 0.2.0.

Version 1.0 (release) will allow specifying width or width/height for
single images and sets of images for the srcset attribute. Cropping
options will be supported as well.

For the most part, this app is intended to be used via template tags.
A demonstation of currently supported functionality follows.

	{% load srcset %}

	{# resize an image attached to instance to fit 500x500 #}
	<img src="{% src instance.image_field 500x500 %}"/>
